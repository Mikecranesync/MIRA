# Hub relationship-writer audit (issue #1721)

**Date:** 2026-06-05 · **Parent:** #1662 · **EPIC:** #1666 · companion to the Python-side `docs/audits/2026-06-04-ingest-edge-write-paths-1662.md` (note: that file lives in the repo root `docs/`; this one is hub-local).

Follow-up to #1716 (Python ingest now proposes). This classifies the **mira-hub TypeScript** writers that touch `kg_relationships` and migrates the first one to propose-by-default.

## Policy (the Iron Rule, stricter than Python)

Per `.claude/skills/managing-the-knowledge-graph` + ADR-0017: **no MIRA-inferred edge is ever written directly to `kg_relationships`.** It lands as a `relationship_proposals` row (via `upsertInferredProposal`); the verified edge is written only on human approval (`proposals/[id]/decide/route.ts`).

Unlike the Python ingest path, the hub has **no `autoverify` escape hatch** for inferred edges — determinism/high-confidence sets *confidence*, never *verified*. The human confirm IS the product. (`MIRA_KG_INGEST_AUTOVERIFY` is a Python-ingest-only migration concession; it does not exist on the hub.)

**Central enforcement (this PR):** `upsertInferredProposal` now guards on `CANONICAL_PROPOSAL_RELATIONSHIP_TYPES` (the `relationship_proposals.relationship_type` CHECK vocabulary, migrations 018→028→032). A non-canonical type is skipped with a warning instead of throwing a CHECK violation that would silently drop the edge.

## Writer classification

| Writer | Class | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `queries.ts::upsertSchematicComponents` | **inferred** (schematic intelligence extracts components + wiring) | ✅ **migrated** (this PR) → proposes via `upsertInferredProposal`. Entity nodes still upserted; edges propose. |
| `proposals/[id]/decide/route.ts` | **safe** | Human-approval verified write — the one legitimate door. Unchanged. |
| `relationship-extractor.ts` (LLM, `confidence ≥ HIGH_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD → INSERT`) | **inferred** — the literal "confidence > X → verify" anti-pattern | ⛔ TODO: route through `upsertInferredProposal`. Predicates already validated by `isRelationshipType`; map/validate to canonical. |
| `extractor.ts::upsertRelationship` (conversation extraction, conf 1.0) | **inferred** | ⛔ TODO: propose. |
| `cmms-sync.ts::upsertRelationship` (conf 1.0) | **inferred** (mirrors CMMS structural data — still a proposal per Iron Rule) | ⛔ TODO + **blocker**: emits `has_work_order` (lowercase) which is **not in the proposals CHECK**. Needs a CHECK migration (`HAS_WORK_ORDER`) or a canonical map first. |
| `hierarchy-backfill.ts::createParentOf` | **decision → inferred** | ⛔ TODO + **blocker**: it's a *heuristic* location-string match (`entity_id = $2 OR name = $2`), so it is **inferred, not deliberate structure → must propose**. Blocker: `parent_of` is **not** in the proposals CHECK; map to `LOCATED_IN` (equipment → area/line) or add to the CHECK. Decision recorded: **propose**, not auto-verify. |
| `queries.ts::createRelationship` | **dead code** (0 callers in `src/`) | Leave as-is; remove in a follow-up (out of scope here — surgical). |

## Vocabulary note (load-bearing)

Staging ground truth: `kg_relationships` holds a **mix** — lowercase legacy from Python ingest (`has_manual`, `documented_in`, `has_fault_code`, `has_work_order`) + uppercase canonical from hub/schematic paths (`WIRED_TO`, `POWERED_BY`, `MAPS_TO`, `USED_IN_LOGIC`, `CAUSES`, `DRIVES`, `LOCATED_IN`, `HAS_COMPONENT`, `HAS_DOCUMENT`). `relationship_proposals` is **entirely** canonical uppercase (+ `SAME_MODEL_AS`/`CO_FAILED_WITH`/`SIMILAR_TO`).

Implication: schematic edges were already canonical (clean migration, no remap). But `cmms-sync` (`has_work_order`) and `hierarchy-backfill` (`parent_of`) use types **absent from the proposals CHECK** — those migrations are blocked on either a CHECK extension (dev→staging→prod) or a canonical map, and must be sequenced accordingly. `types.ts::RELATIONSHIP_TYPES` (lowercase) is also out of step with the proposals CHECK (uppercase) — reconciling them is a separate cleanup.

## Verification (this PR)

- `vitest` — 4 new tests (`queries-schematic.test.ts`): canonical edge → proposal not `kg_relationships`; non-canonical skipped; missing-endpoint skipped; entities still upserted. 35/35 in the affected suites.
- `eslint` clean on changed files; `tsc` clean on changed files (pre-existing unrelated typecheck errors in `namespace/tree`, `rls-deny`, `command-center-freshness` are not touched here).
- Staging smoke on `factorylm/stg`: `proposals=1 evidence=1 kg_relationships=0`, idempotent, guard skips non-canonical.

## Remaining for #1721

`relationship-extractor.ts`, `extractor.ts`, then `cmms-sync.ts` + `hierarchy-backfill.ts` (after the CHECK/mapping decision). #1721 stays open until all are propose-by-default or explicitly justified. CI guard for unguarded inserts = #1722; canary = #1723.
