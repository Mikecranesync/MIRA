- Top SHIP: `MIRA/feat/agents-celery-routines` — High money-path + ready — push it out
- Top FINISH: `MIRA/fix/deploy-include-bots-in-targets` — On money-path, advanceable — invest the hours
- Orchestrator: vs 04:11 — SHIP 3→2 (−1, feat/hub-command-center fell back to FINISH after a fresh 0-day commit reset its blended score), FINISH 14→15 (+1); DEFER 99 / KILL 101 flat. 0 sub-agents dispatched (0 FINISH meet money≥4 ∧ ready≥3; best are hub-command-center + phase2 at money 3/ready 4, deploy-include-bots at money 5/ready 2). 5 KILL ≥60d surfaced for founder review (factorylm 83–90d: ops/charlie-node-setup, feat/open-brain, stash@{0}, chore/arrested-development-foundation, fix/ci-watchdog — NOT dropped). Both SHIP branches are local-only → need push+PR before merge. Top drift: 47 MIRA branches + 11 stashes stale >30d. Cold-cache scan timed out once; re-ran warm in 19s. Artifact re-rendered + pushed.

## 2026-06-01 12:11 UTC
- Counts: {'SHIP': 2, 'FINISH': 6, 'DEFER': 95, 'KILL': 68}
- Drift alerts: 5
- Top SHIP: `MIRA/feat/agents-celery-routines` — High money-path + ready — push it out
- Top FINISH: `MIRA/feat/hub-command-center` — On money-path, advanceable — invest the hours
- Orchestrator: vs 08:14 — FINISH 15→6 (−9), DEFER 99→95 (−4), KILL 101→68 (−33); SHIP 2 flat. ~46 fewer total streams (217→171) — large branch/stash cleanup since last cycle; data internally consistent (92 branches + 64 stashes MIRA, scan→score→render agree). 0 sub-agents dispatched (0 FINISH meet money≥4 ∧ ready≥3; best are hub-command-center + phase2 at money 3/ready 4). Both SHIP branches (feat/agents-celery-routines, feat/uns-node-centric-knowledge) local-only at 66445d31 → need push+PR before merge. 5 KILL ≥60d surfaced for founder review (factorylm 84–90d: feat/open-brain, ops/charlie-node-setup, stash@{0}, chore/arrested-development-foundation, fix/ci-watchdog — NOT dropped).

- Counts: {'FINISH': 7, 'DEFER': 97, 'KILL': 68}
- Drift alerts: 5
- Top FINISH: `MIRA/feat/agents-celery-routines` — On money-path, advanceable — invest the hours
- Orchestrator: vs 12:11 — SHIP 2→0 (−2), FINISH 6→7 (+1), DEFER 95→97 (+2), KILL 68 flat. Both prior SHIP branches (feat/agents-celery-routines, feat/uns-node-centric-knowledge) fell to FINISH as readiness dropped 4→3 — they are identical duplicates at 66445d31, 2 ahead / 5 behind main. 1 sub-agent dispatched (Plan, ship-readiness on the dup branch): confirmed REBASE-CLEAN (zero conflicts vs main's 5 commits), no main overlap, migration 030 is next free slot; verify = `bash install/smoke_test.sh` + `cd mira-hub && npm test`. 5 KILL ≥60d (factorylm 84–91d: ops/charlie-node-setup, feat/open-brain, stash@{0}, chore/arrested-development-foundation, fix/ci-watchdog) surfaced for founder review — NOT dropped. Top drift: 41 MIRA branches + 11 stashes stale >30d. Artifact re-rendered + pushed.

## 2026-06-02 00:11 UTC
- Counts: {'FINISH': 7, 'DEFER': 99, 'KILL': 68}
- Drift alerts: 5
- Top FINISH: `MIRA/feat/agents-celery-routines` — On money-path, advanceable — invest the hours

## 2026-06-02 00:11 UTC
- Counts vs prior: DEFER 97→99 (+2), FINISH 7 flat, KILL 68 flat, SHIP 0. No SHIP items.
- Top FINISH: `MIRA/feat/agents-celery-routines` (money 5/5, ready 3/5, 3d).
- Dispatched 1 general-purpose sub-agent (read-only, merge-tree only — working tree dirty on feat/hub-command-center, 171 entries) to refresh the STALE rebase-readiness call on the dup branch. Verdict: **REBASE-CLEAN** vs `origin/main` 8d6c263d — branch's 17 files have zero overlap with main's 37 commits; migration 030 slot FREE (highest on main is 029). Caught local `main` ref stale (3323fc1d, 32 behind origin) — that's why scan read "37 behind." Founder can rebase + open PR after `bash install/smoke_test.sh && (cd mira-hub && npm test)`.
- NOT dispatched on identical twin `feat/uns-node-centric-knowledge` (byte-identical 66445d31 — pure waste per anti-patterns). "up to 2" → 1 by design.
- 5 KILL≥60d surfaced for founder review, NOT dropped (factorylm 84–91d: ops/charlie-node-setup, feat/open-brain, stash@{0}, chore/arrested-development-foundation, fix/ci-watchdog).
- Top drift: 41 MIRA branches + 11 stashes stale >30d; dirty working tree on feat/hub-command-center. Artifact re-rendered + pushed.

## 2026-06-02 04:11 UTC
- Counts: {'FINISH': 7, 'DEFER': 98, 'KILL': 69}
- Drift alerts: 5
- Top FINISH: `MIRA/feat/agents-celery-routines` — On money-path, advanceable — invest the hours

## 2026-06-02 04:11 UTC (orchestrator narrative)
- Counts vs 00:11: DEFER 99→98 (−1), KILL 68→69 (+1), FINISH 7 flat, SHIP 0. Effectively flat — one DEFER stream aged into KILL.
- Top FINISH: `MIRA/feat/agents-celery-routines` (money 5/5, ready 3/5, 3d) @ 66445d31, 2 ahead of origin/main (cc4c08d4), merge-base 16c4d3b4, 17 files +1145/−2.
- Dispatched 1 general-purpose sub-agent (read-only ship-readiness CODE REVIEW of the actual 17-file diff — feature-dev:code-reviewer unavailable this env, substituted + noted). VERDICT: **SHIP-READY**, all 7 MIRA-constraint checks pass: no Anthropic; tree/display routes key on uns_path + migration 030 canonical LTREE (equipment_id optional soft-link); Command Center is watch-only (fetches own tree, never reaches chat/diagnose) so direct-connection gate correctly N/A; 030 is next free slot; no real secrets; tools/agents Python std-clean; /command-center gated to ADMIN_ROLES. Zero blocking nits. Verify: `bash install/smoke_test.sh && (cd mira-hub && npm test)`.
- NOT dispatched on byte-identical twin `feat/uns-node-centric-knowledge` (same commit+tree 66445d31, empty diff — pure waste). "up to 2" → 1 by design.
- 5 KILL≥60d still pending founder review, NOT dropped (factorylm 84–91d: ops/charlie-node-setup, feat/open-brain, stash@{0}, chore/arrested-development-foundation, fix/ci-watchdog).
- Top drift: 41 MIRA branches + 11 stashes stale >30d; dirty working tree on feat/hub-command-center (6 mod + 170 untracked). Artifact re-rendered + pushed.
- Blocker unchanged: #1 money-path branch is SHIP-READY + rebase-clean but LOCAL-ONLY for ≥4 cycles. Lever is founder push+PR+merge, not more analysis.

## 2026-06-02 08:16 UTC
- Counts: {'FINISH': 7, 'DEFER': 100, 'KILL': 69}
- Drift alerts: 4
- Top FINISH: `MIRA/feat/agents-celery-routines` — On money-path, advanceable — invest the hours

## 2026-06-02 08:16 UTC (orchestrator narrative)
- Counts vs 04:11: DEFER 98→100 (+2, two recent stashes), FINISH 7 / KILL 69 flat, SHIP 0. Drift 5→4 (factorylm stash-prune line cleared). Total streams 174→176.
- Top FINISH: `MIRA/feat/agents-celery-routines` (money 5/5, ready 3/5, 3d) @ 66445d31, 5 ahead / 2 behind main, 17 files +1145/−2.
- **Infra fix:** `scan.sh` was timing out on factorylm `git status` (>20s untracked-enum over the slow mount). Patched `sh()` to take a timeout + status now runs `--untracked-files=no --ignore-submodules=all` capped at 10s. Scan completed in 14s. Tradeoff: factorylm untracked count now 0 (tracked-`modified` preserved; that's what scoring uses).
- Dispatched 1 read-only `Plan` sub-agent (feature-dev:code-architect unavailable this env — substituted + noted) for a FINISH→SHIP plan on the dup branch. Verdict: **SHIP-READY, top blocker = zero tests**; migration 030 idempotent/RLS-correct (manual rollback only); UNS-compliant; Command Center is watch-only so direct-connection gate correctly N/A in Phase 1. **NEW finding:** Ignition `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` blanks the Phase-1 iframe → live demo blocked until an origin-root XFO-stripping proxy lands. Plan saved to `wiki/orchestrator/finish-plan-command-center.md`.
- NOT dispatched on byte-identical twin `feat/uns-node-centric-knowledge` (same tree 66445d31 — pure waste). "up to 2" → 1 by design.
- 5 KILL≥60d still pending founder review, NOT dropped (factorylm 84–91d: ops/charlie-node-setup, feat/open-brain, stash@{0}, chore/arrested-development-foundation, fix/ci-watchdog).
- Top drift: 41 MIRA branches + 11 stashes stale >30d; 12 factorylm branches stale.
- **Blocker unchanged (≥5 cycles): the #1 money-path stream is SHIP-READY + rebase-clean but LOCAL-ONLY.** Lever = founder push+PR+merge (+ XFO proxy for demo), not more analysis. Artifact re-rendered + pushed.

## 2026-06-02 12:12 UTC
- Counts: {'FINISH': 8, 'DEFER': 99, 'KILL': 69}
- Drift alerts: 4
- Top FINISH: `MIRA/feat/agents-celery-routines` — On money-path, advanceable — invest the hours
- Delta vs 08:16: FINISH 7→8 (+`feat/dt2026-gap-closure` money3/ready4), DEFER 100→99, KILL 69=.
- Sub-agents dispatched: 0. Both money=5/ready=3 FINISH items (`feat/agents-celery-routines` == `feat/uns-node-centric-knowledge`) are the SAME unchanged HEAD `66445d31`, already fully planned at 08:16 (`finish-plan-command-center.md`). Re-dispatch = waste; chose safer no-op. Lever is founder push+PR+merge + XFO proxy, not analysis.
- KILL≥60d: 5, surfaced not dropped (founder review): feat/open-brain 91d, ops/charlie-node-setup 91d, stash@{0} 89d, chore/arrested-development-foundation 87d, fix/ci-watchdog 85d.
- Top drift: 3 branch names on one HEAD (consolidate to 1 PR); 41 MIRA + 12 factorylm branches stale >30d; 11 MIRA stashes >30d. Artifact re-rendered + pushed.

- Drift alerts: 4
- Top FINISH: `MIRA/feat/agents-celery-routines` — On money-path, advanceable — invest the hours
- **2026-06-02 16:13 UTC** — Counts FINISH 8→7, DEFER 99→100, KILL 69 (176 total). No SHIP. Top-2 FINISH (`feat/agents-celery-routines`, `feat/uns-node-centric-knowledge`) are IDENTICAL duplicates (SHA 66445d31). Dispatched 1 Plan sub-agent → VERDICT **SUPERSEDED/KILL**: Phase-1 Command Center work is already on `feat/hub-command-center` (32 ahead) as patch-identical commit 91c6180c; only unique content is off-path `tools/agents/` Celery files (from parent 58857380). Recommend closing both duplicates; canonical Command Center work lives on the hub-command-center family. Migration note: `031` collision already resolved on hub family (phase2 renumbered 031→032). 5 KILL branches now >60d (oldest ops/charlie-node-setup 92d) — surfaced, not dropped. Drift: 11 MIRA stashes >30d, 41 MIRA branches >30d untouched.

## 2026-06-02 20:11 UTC (orchestrator narrative)
- Counts vs 16:12: DEFER 100→99 (−1), KILL 69→70 (+1), FINISH 7 / SHIP 0 flat. 176 total streams — effectively flat; one DEFER stream aged past the KILL threshold.
- Top FINISH: `feat/agents-celery-routines` (money 5/ready 3, 4d) @ 66445d31 — byte-identical twin of `feat/uns-node-centric-knowledge` (same SHA re-confirmed this run).
- **Sub-agents dispatched: 0.** The only two money≥4∧ready≥3 items are that identical-SHA twin pair, UNCHANGED since the 16:12 Plan dispatch returned VERDICT=SUPERSEDED (Phase-1 Command Center work already lives on `feat/hub-command-center` as patch-identical 91c6180c; twins' only unique content is off-path `tools/agents/` Celery files). Re-analyzing an unchanged superseded SHA = pure waste (anti-pattern). Chose safer no-op; plan already saved at `wiki/orchestrator/finish-plan-command-center.md`.
- Canonical money-path branch `feat/hub-command-center` advanced to 194ae9e2 (0-day commit) but scores money 3 → below the money≥4 dispatch threshold. Real blocker (per 08:16 plan): zero tests + Ignition `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` blanks the Phase-1 iframe → needs an origin-root XFO-stripping proxy before the live demo.
- KILL≥60d: 5 surfaced for founder review, NOT dropped (factorylm 84–92d: ops/charlie-node-setup, feat/open-brain, stash@{0}, chore/arrested-development-foundation, fix/ci-watchdog).
- Top drift: 41 MIRA branches + 11 MIRA stashes stale >30d; 12 factorylm branches stale. Artifact re-rendered + pushed.

## 2026-06-03 00:12 UTC (orchestrator narrative)
- Counts vs 20:11: DEFER 99→102 (+3), FINISH 7→6 (−1), KILL 70 / SHIP 0 flat. 178 total (+2). `stash@{18}` demoted FINISH→DEFER (readiness 1→0 as it aged to 14d); +2 net new stashes (stashes 62→64).
- **Sub-agents dispatched: 0.** Both money≥4∧ready≥3 items — `feat/agents-celery-routines` and `feat/uns-node-centric-knowledge` — remain byte-identical twins at the SAME unchanged SHA `66445d31` (tree `e6ef4b33`) already adjudicated SUPERSEDED at the 08:16 + 20:11 runs. Re-analyzing an unchanged superseded SHA = pure waste (anti-pattern). Unique content vs canonical `feat/hub-command-center` is still only off-path `tools/agents/` Celery files + wiki deletions. Plan persists at `wiki/orchestrator/finish-plan-command-center.md`.
- Canonical money-path branch `feat/hub-command-center` advanced again: 194ae9e2 → `79aa7553` (0-day). Scores money 3/ready 4 — below the money≥4 auto-dispatch gate, so handed to founder as a time-box, not a sub-agent. Real blocker unchanged: zero tests on Command Center code + Ignition `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` blanks the Phase-1 iframe (needs origin-root XFO-stripping proxy before live demo).
- KILL≥60d: same 5 factorylm streams surfaced for founder review, NOT dropped (ops/charlie-node-setup 92d, feat/open-brain 91d, stash@{0} 90d, chore/arrested-development-foundation 87d, fix/ci-watchdog 85d).
- Top drift: 41 MIRA branches + 11 MIRA stashes stale >30d; 12 factorylm branches + 1 factorylm stash stale. Artifact re-rendered (77,984 B) + pushed.

## 2026-06-03 04:12 UTC (orchestrator narrative)
- Counts vs 00:12: DEFER 102→105 (+3 net new stashes; stashes 64→~67), FINISH 6 / KILL 70 / SHIP 0 flat. Drift 4 flat. Total streams 178→181.
- Top FINISH: `feat/agents-celery-routines` (money 5/ready 3, 4d) @ `66445d31` (tree `e6ef4b33`) — byte-identical twin of `feat/uns-node-centric-knowledge` (same SHA + tree re-verified this run).
- **Sub-agents dispatched: 0.** The only two money≥4∧ready≥3 items are that identical-SHA twin pair, UNCHANGED since 08:16. Re-confirmed SUPERSEDED this run by patch-id: twin tip patch-id `ed4d8c6f…` == commit `91c6180c` already on canonical `feat/hub-command-center`. Re-analyzing an unchanged, superseded, byte-identical SHA = pure waste (anti-pattern). Chose safer no-op; plan persists at `wiki/orchestrator/finish-plan-command-center.md`.
- **Escalating recommendation:** twins have drifted to **75 behind origin/main** (main burst — 187 recent commits; head `9282fa1c`). Superseded + increasingly stale → recommend founder CLOSE both duplicate branches. NOT dropped (founder reviews kills).
- Canonical money-path branch `feat/hub-command-center` advanced 194ae9e2 → `4ea729de` (commit 58 min ago, asset-graph architecture docs). Scores money 3/ready 4 — below the money≥4 auto-dispatch gate → founder time-box, not sub-agent. Real blocker unchanged: zero tests on Command Center code + Ignition `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` blanks the Phase-1 iframe (needs origin-root XFO-stripping proxy before live demo).
- KILL≥60d: same 5 factorylm streams surfaced for founder review, NOT dropped (ops/charlie-node-setup ~92d, feat/open-brain ~91d, stash@{0} ~90d, chore/arrested-development-foundation ~87d, fix/ci-watchdog ~85d).
- Top drift: 41 MIRA branches + 11 MIRA stashes stale >30d; 12 factorylm branches + 1 factorylm stash stale. Artifact re-rendered (79,236 B) + pushed.

- Top FINISH: `MIRA/feat/agents-celery-routines` — On money-path, advanceable — invest the hours
- **orchestrator-pulse (automated decision layer):** Δ vs prev — DEFER +1, KILL +1, FINISH 6, no SHIP. Top-2 FINISH `feat/agents-celery-routines` and `feat/uns-node-centric-knowledge` are the SAME commit (66445d31) — DUPLICATE branches, collapsed to 1 Plan-agent dispatch. Finding: Command Center Phase-1 code is effectively ship-ready (0 UNS violations); remaining gaps are operational only — apply migration 030, seed conveyor display, add 030 to db:check-order (~70 min to PR). KILL-review (>60d, all factorylm, founder decides): ops/charlie-node-setup(92d), feat/open-brain(91d, likely already merged — verify), chore/arrested-development-foundation(88d), fix/ci-watchdog(85d), stash@{0}(90d).

## 2026-06-03 12:12 UTC (orchestrator-pulse — automated decision layer)
- Δ vs 08:11: DEFER 106→105 (−1), KILL 71→72 (+1), FINISH 6 flat, SHIP 0. `fix/staging-tenant-uuid-validation` (15d) aged into KILL; one stash demoted DEFER→KILL at the 30d line. 183 total streams.
- **Sub-agents dispatched: 0 (correct no-op).** Only money≥4∧ready≥3 items are the twin pair `feat/agents-celery-routines` + `feat/uns-node-centric-knowledge` — re-verified this run as byte-identical at UNCHANGED SHA `66445d31` (tree `e6ef4b33`, 5d). Supersession re-confirmed by patch-id: twin tip `ed4d8c6f` == canonical `feat/hub-command-center` commit `91c6180c`. Re-analyzing an unchanged, superseded, identical SHA = documented waste anti-pattern. Plan persists at `wiki/orchestrator/finish-plan-command-center.md`.
- **Escalating CLOSE recommendation:** twins now **78 behind origin/main** (was 75 @ 04:12) — superseded + worsening drift. Founder should close both duplicate branches.
- Canonical money-path branch `feat/hub-command-center` @ `44184ecc` (unchanged since ~05:12; not advanced in last 4h). Scores money 3/ready 4 — below the money≥4 auto-dispatch gate → founder time-box, not sub-agent. 08:11 plan still current: apply migration 030 + seed conveyor display + add 030 to db:check-order (~70 min to PR). Real blocker unchanged: zero tests + Ignition `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` blanks the Phase-1 iframe.
- KILL≥60d (5, all factorylm, founder decides — NOT dropped): feat/open-brain 92d (likely already merged — verify), ops/charlie-node-setup 92d, stash@{0} 90d, chore/arrested-development-foundation 88d, fix/ci-watchdog 86d.
- Top drift: 41 MIRA branches + 11 MIRA stashes stale >30d; 12 factorylm branches + 1 factorylm stash stale. Artifact re-rendered (80,042 B) + pushed to live `mira-orchestrator`.

- Drift alerts: 4
- Top FINISH: `MIRA/feat/agents-celery-routines` — On money-path, advanceable — invest the hours
- Orchestrator decision (16:11): 0 SHIP. The 2 gate-clearing FINISH branches (feat/uns-node-centric-knowledge, feat/agents-celery-routines) are BYTE-IDENTICAL @66445d31 (Command Center Phase-1) -> collapsed to ONE Plan-agent dispatch on the shared mira-hub Command Center surface (drift logged). Verdict: NO-GO as iframe PR (Ignition X-Frame-Options:SAMEORIGIN blanks the display embed in command-center/page.tsx; zero tests on tree+display routes).

Highest money-path stream = `feat/agents-celery-routines` (money 5/ready 3) tagged KILL: "158 behind main" — **but local `main` is 153 behind `origin/main` (0 ahead/153 behind)**, so the behind-counts inflating every KILL tag are measured against a stale local ref.

Two drivers: (1) MIRA stash cleanup 64→3 (−61) cleared most DEFER + the MIRA-stash drift line; (2) `tools/orchestrator/scan.sh` rebuilt 02:38 UTC (scan.sh.bak = May 31) — fixes the stale-local-main behind-count bug flagged at 06-04 16:11, so `feat/hub-command-center` now scores FINISH not KILL. gh still absent (prs=0/issues=0) → branch/stash-only.
