# Gate 7 adjudication — PR #3481

**Verdict:** PASS · **Effort:** xhigh · **Adjudicator:** groq (openai/gpt-oss-120b)
**Prior findings:** 4 · **Rulings:** 4 (sustained: 0)

> Verdict is computed structurally: rulings must be an exact bijection onto the
> prior findings by stable id; severity comes from the parsed prior report, never
> the adjudicator; any SUSTAINED high ⇒ BLOCK; any duplicate/unknown/missing/extra
> id ⇒ UNKNOWN. Both phases are preserved intact as evidence.

## Prior findings (structural ids)

- F1 [high] Documentation claims a code fix in `mira-crawler/ingest/origins.py` that lower‑cases scheme
- F2 [high] Documentation asserts that the `canonical_source_url` function now lower‑cases
- F3 [high] The PR states that a new contract test file `test_conflict_and_packaging_contracts.py` has been added and wired into CI, yet the diff adds
- F4 [medium] Documentation repeats the claim that the `_read_validated` guard bug (R12‑F1) has been refuted, yet the only supporting evidence is a citation of a prior adjudication artifact, not a present‑tense assertion backed by code changes or new tests in this PR.
