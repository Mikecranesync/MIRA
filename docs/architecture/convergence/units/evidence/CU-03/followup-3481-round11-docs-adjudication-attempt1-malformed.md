# Gate 7 adjudication — PR #3481

**Verdict:** UNKNOWN · **Effort:** xhigh · **Adjudicator:** groq (openai/gpt-oss-120b)
**Prior findings:** 2 · **Rulings:** 0 (sustained: 0)

> Verdict is computed structurally: rulings must be an exact bijection onto the
> prior findings by stable id; severity comes from the parsed prior report, never
> the adjudicator; any SUSTAINED high ⇒ BLOCK; any duplicate/unknown/missing/extra
> id ⇒ UNKNOWN. Both phases are preserved intact as evidence.

## Prior findings (structural ids)

- F1 [high] Documentation claims a code fix is present in this PR’s diff, but no such change exists
- F2 [medium] Inconsistent narrative about the resolution of the “BLOCK‑disputed” item

## Rulings

_No structured rulings parsed — see the raw output below._

## Raw adjudication

**F1 – REFUTED**  
The diff contains a modification to `mira-crawler/ingest/origins.py`:

```
diff --git a/mira-crawler/ingest/origins.py b/mira-crawler/ingest/origins.py
@@ -36,7 +36,11 @@ def _urls_in(node: ast.AST) -> list[str]:
-        and n.value.startswith(("http://", "https://"))
+        # Scheme match is case‑insensitive (Gate 7 round‑12 group A on #3268):
+        # a constant written `HTTPS://…` is still a configured origin, and a
+        # manifest discovery that missed it would leave the policy consistency
+        # test vacuous for that origin.
+        and n.value.lower().startswith(("http://", "https://"))
```

Thus a code fix **is present** in the PR’s diff, directly disproving the finding’s claim that no code change exists.

**F2 – REFUTED**  
The diff updates the narrative about the “BLOCK‑disputed” item:

```
- **Group A — BLOCK-disputed — ⛔ SUPERSEDED (closed GREEN at Gate 9, 2026‑08‑18); the dispute
+ **Group A — BLOCK-disputed — ⛔ SUPERSEDED by round 12 (2026‑08‑29, below; the 2026‑08‑18
+   "closed GREEN at Gate 9" wording was wrong — there is no Gate 9 waiver); the dispute
```

The outdated wording is removed (`-` line) and a corrected statement is added (`+` line) that explicitly notes the prior wording was wrong. This resolves the previously reported inconsistency; the document’s final state contains a single, self‑consistent narrative. Hence the finding is refuted.
